## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
*   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
*   npm (included with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JohnMedlock/Financial-Helper.git
    cd Financial-Helper
    ```
2.  Install backend dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```
3.  Install frontend dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```
4.  Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following variables:

    ```
    PORT=3000
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    ```
5.  Start the development servers:

    **Backend**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run dev
    ```

    **Frontend**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```

After both servers start, you can access:

*   Frontend: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
*   Backend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Problems Faced

*   **CORS Issues:** We encountered Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues when integrating with third-party APIs, particularly when fetching 3D models from Meshy. To resolve this, we implemented a proxy middleware in our backend to handle the requests and set the appropriate CORS headers.
*   **Asynchronous Data Handling:** Managing asynchronous data flow between the frontend and backend, especially when dealing with external APIs, required careful handling of promises and async/await. We used useEffect hooks and state management techniques to ensure data consistency and prevent race conditions.
*   **3D Model Optimization:** Optimizing 3D models for web rendering was a challenge. We addressed this by using efficient model formats (like GLB), compressing textures, and implementing level-of-detail (LOD) techniques to improve performance on different devices.
*   **AI Integration:** Integrating the OpenAI API for natural language processing and AI interactions required careful prompt engineering and error handling. We implemented rate limiting and fallback mechanisms to ensure a smooth user experience even when the API was under heavy load.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** Implementing secure authentication and authorization using JWTs required careful attention to detail. We followed best practices for storing and handling tokens, and we implemented role-based access control to protect sensitive API endpoints.
*   **Responsive Design:** Ensuring a responsive design that works well on different screen sizes and devices was a challenge. We used CSS media queries and flexible layouts to create a consistent user experience across all platforms.
*   **Graph Rendering with Chart.js:** We faced challenges rendering financial graphs using Chart.js, particularly with performance and responsiveness on different devices. We addressed this by optimizing data structures, implementing lazy loading, and fine-tuning chart configurations for better performance.
